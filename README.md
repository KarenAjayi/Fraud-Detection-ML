# Financial Fraud Detection with the Application of Machine Learning

## üìå Executive Summary
With the rise of digital transactions, financial fraud has become a growing concern for financial institutions. This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and classify fraudulent transcations, ensuring better security in finicial systems. 

## üéØ Project Objective
The aim of this project is to identify the most effective machine learning algorithms for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, considering the challenges of imbalanced data and real-world transaction patterns.

## üîç Methodology
- **Business Understanding**: Analyzed real-world fraud detection challenges and the importance of early fraud detection.
- **Data Understanding**: Utilized a credit card transaction dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 284,807 transactions, of which only 0.172% were fraudulent (severe class imbalance).
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Applied **Principal Component ANalysis (PCA)** to anonymize transaction details.
  - Used **Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to handle class imbalance.
  - Performed exploratory data analysis, including **correlation analysis and time-series analysis**.
- **Machine Learning Models Applied**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
  - **Ensemble Learning**: Random Forest.
  - **Hybrid Learning**: Combined Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
  - **Deep Learning**: Neural netwoks for sequential modeling.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Metrics used: **Accuracy, Preciosion, Recall, F1-score**.
  - Compared performance on **original, under-sampled, and over-sampled datasets**.

## üìä Key Results & Findings
- **Deep Learning models outperformed other models**, achieving **100% accuracy and 91% F1-score**, demonstrating superior fraud detection capability.
- **Class imbalance significantly impacted traditional models** like Logistic Regressionand Naive Bayes, highlighting the need for resampling techniques.
- **Evaluation using only Accuracy is misleading**, as models can appear highly accurate while failing to detect fraud correctly. Precision, Recall, and F1-score provided a more accurate assessment of model effectiveness.

## üöÄ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost).
- **Data Handling**: SQL, Microsoft Excel.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Project Framework**: CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).

# üìå Key Takeaways
This project provides a comprehensive approach to **credit card fraud detection**, demonstrating how **machine learning and deep learning techniques** can enhance fraud prevention strategies. The findings emphasize the importance of handling **imbalanced datasets**, choosing **appropriate evaluation metrics**, and leveraging **advanced machine learning models** for real-world applications.
